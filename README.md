## Course Information

### Calendar Description
Students are introduced how to apply a variety of concepts related to regression. Students learn a variety of concepts related to the simple linear regression model including coefficient of determination and basic inferences. Students extend their understanding and application to other linear regressions such as multiple and logistic regressions. Students learn how to perform other variants of regression including time-series and nonparametric regression. Students learn various methods of diagnostics, types of fallacies, and other issues that can arise in regression.

### Educational Objectives
Upon completion of the course the students will be expected to:
1. Create and appraise a variety of regression models.
2. Identify when regression is appropriate or inappropriate for various situations.
3. Apply regression to a variety of data types.
4. Select a type of regression based on the nature of the data and purpose of the investigation.
5. Assess the quality of models, predictions, and inferences of various regression models.
6. Understand and interpret regression notation.

### Course Topics
1. Introduction to statistical models
2. Model formulas and coefficients
3. Linear regression estimation and assumptions
4. Model selection
5. Predictions with statistical models
6. Generalized linear models
7. Regularization methods
  - Binary logistic regression
  - Models for count data
  - Continuous generalized linear models
8. Smoothers
9. (S)ARIMA models
